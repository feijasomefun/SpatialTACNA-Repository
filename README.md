# SpatialTACNA-Repository
This repository provides a semi-automatic pipeline for preprocessing 10x Visium spatial transcriptomics data into RDS format, along with scripts implementing Spatial-TACNAâ€”a method for mapping the effects of copy number alterations (CNAs) at the spatial spot level in spatial transcriptomics samples.
